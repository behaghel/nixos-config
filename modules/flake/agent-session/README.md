# Agent sessions for devenv

Project-scoped Git worktrees for concurrent coding agents. Includes `agent-session`,
its executable shorthand `as`, and dynamic Bash, Zsh, and Fish completions.

## Adopt in a project

Add to `devenv.yaml` (reuse an existing input for this repository if present):

```yaml
inputs:
  nixos-config:
    url: github:behaghel/nixos-config
    flake: false
imports:
  - nixos-config/modules/flake/agent-session
```

Enable in `devenv.nix`:

```nix
agentSession.enable = true;
```

Add `/.worktrees/` to `.gitignore`. Commit project setup before creating sessions:
creation requires a clean primary checkout on the upstream remote's default branch.
The remote tip is fetched for creation; `status` does not fetch unless requested.
The default agent is `pi`, which must be available in your environment.

```sh
as create my-task                   # prepare without launching a nested agent
as start my-task                    # prepare and launch Pi
as status                          # reconcile worktrees and session records
as launch my-task                   # launch in an existing worktree
as resume my-task                   # launch with --continue
as finish my-task --dry-run         # preview local cleanup
as finish my-task                   # guarded local cleanup, with confirmation
```

Session metadata remains in the shared Git directory at
`agent-session/sessions/`. Existing Herbert sessions need no data migration.
Cleanup preserves remote assets and refuses unsafe work unless explicitly forced.

## Project settings

```nix
agentSession = {
  enable = true;
  worktreeRoot = ".worktrees";
  agentCommand = [ "pi" ];
  prepareCommand = [ ];
  localLinks = [ "devenv.local.nix" ".envrc.local" ];
};
```

Local links are explicit ignored paths, not automatic secret copying. Keep
project-specific links and preparation commands in the consuming project.

## Completions

Both command names have installed completions. The module exports
`AGENT_SESSION_COMPLETION_ROOT` and defaults `DIRENV_ZSH_COMPLETION_DIRS` to its
Zsh completion directory. This repository's managed post-direnv hook registers
these after `compinit`, preserves existing completions, and restores registrations
on project exit. Plain direnv cannot register completions in an already-running
Zsh without that shell integration.

Projects with their own completions override the directory list explicitly:

```nix
env.DIRENV_ZSH_COMPLETION_DIRS =
  "${config.env.AGENT_SESSION_COMPLETION_ROOT}/zsh/site-functions:${myCompletions}/share/zsh/site-functions";
```

Do not export `FPATH` through direnv: it replaces the running shell's `fpath`.
Manual loading is also available:

```sh
source <(agent-session completion bash)
agent-session completion fish | source
```

For manual Zsh setup, save `agent-session completion zsh` output as
`_agent_session` in a directory on `fpath`, then rerun `compinit`.

## Runtime and verification

The command uses Nix-provided Node.js 24's native TypeScript support and Git.
It needs no npm dependencies, install step, or Bun runtime. Bun remains only in
this repository's optional regression-test profile; the default shell does not
include it. Package cache availability still depends on the consumer's nixpkgs pin.

From this repository:

```sh
devenv -q --profile agent-session-tests build outputs.agent-session-tests
devenv -q --profile agent-session-tests shell -- bash tests/zsh-direnv-completion.sh
```

The regression tests run the CLI with Node against disposable local Git remotes.
They cover creation, resumption, recovery, cleanup guards, installed completions,
and default-on template wiring. The Nix check also runs outside a Git checkout.
