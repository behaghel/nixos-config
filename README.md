# NixOS Configurations

This repository uses Nix flakes. Development environments and formatting are provided via `nix develop` and `treefmt` with the [Alejandra](https://github.com/kamadorueda/alejandra) formatter.

An `.editorconfig` file defines the coding style so that editors can enforce it while editing.

Git hooks are stored in the `githooks` directory. Point `core.hooksPath` to this folder to automatically format code after each commit:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath githooks
```

## Running checks

Use `nix flake check` to evaluate the defined system configurations and verify formatting.

## Workflow

This repository follows the [nixos-unified](https://nixos-unified.org/#why) conventions. nixos-unified exposes several `nix run` commands to manage the configuration throughout its life cycle.

### Activate
Run `nix run .#activate` once on a new machine to set up links and defaults.

### Apply changes
After editing the configuration, build and switch to it with `nix run .#switch`. Use `.#boot`, `.#test`, or `.#build` for the corresponding `nixos-rebuild` actions.

### Roll back
If needed, revert to the previous generation via `nix run .#rollback`.

### Update sources
Refresh flake inputs by executing `nix run .#update`.
